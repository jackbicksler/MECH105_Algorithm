# Special Matrix

## How to Use.
- This algorithm makes a matrix (size however you want) that will be numbered 1 - n and 1 - m in the first column and first row. The other values in the matrix are conceived by adding the number above it and the number to the left of that space. For example: if you have A(3,3) this value would be calculated by adding A(2,3) and A(3,2).

## Function Variables
### Inputs
1. n: number of rows wanted
2. m: number of columns wanted

### Outputs
1. A: matrix as a result of function that is n x m.

## Limitations
- No limitations known.
