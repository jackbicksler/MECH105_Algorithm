### Linear Regression Algorithm

## How to use!
- This algorithm finds a linear equation for a group of data points. In order to use this algorithm all you need is 2 sets of data in an array. These arrays need to have the same amount of points. This algorithm removes outliers in the data so the equation isn't affected by these outliers. It will also solve for the R^2 of your data.

### Function Variables

## Outputs
1. fX: original array of data but with outliers(if any) removed
2. fY: original array of data but with outliers(if any) removed
3. slope: slope of the new linear equation (m in y=mx+b)
4. intercept: intercept of new linear equation (b in y=mx+b)
5. Rsquared: The R^2 value of the Coefficient of Determination

## Inputs
1. x: array of independent data set
2. y: array of dependent data set
