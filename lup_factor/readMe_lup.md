# LUP Factroization Algorithm

## How to Use.
- This algorithm is a based off of LUP factorization or decomposition which is built off of Gaussian Elimination. This code is a form of linear algebra that finds the determinant of a matrix. It also pivots unlike Gaussian Elimination which makes it better. LUP decomposition is a way of solving systems of linear equations

## Function Variables
### Inputs
1. A: any matrix that is a square

### Outputs
1. L: lower triangular matrix of all the multiplication factors that cancelled out the system of equations
2. U: Solved upper triangle matrix of all the systems of equations solved and cancelled so it is able to be solved.
3. P: same as L but is pivoted

## Limitations
- does not work with big matrices, 3x3 is the best.
